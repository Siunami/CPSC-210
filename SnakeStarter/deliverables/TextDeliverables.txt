Hypothese from Task M5
1. From testing method: rotateRight()
   bug is that the snake does not properly rotate right when the direction is DIRECTION.UP

2. From testing method: eat()
   bug is that when snake eats a new food, snake's nutritionalConsumed value is replaced, when it should add.


Design Principle from Task M6
The test: testIsGameOverMoveUp fails.
The test assumes that moving snake 5 times up will end the game.
This is only true when the snake is 5 tiles away from the wall in vertical distance.
if the vertical distance become larger, or snake's starting position change, the test fails.
It should instead have a value relative to its current position and vertical boundaries.
